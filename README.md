# AnimeBoard

![Build Status](https://ci.imjustdoom.com/job/AnimeBoard/badge/icon)

Designed to be a good scoreboard plugin! Should support all versions between 1.8 and 1.21, only tested in 1.8 and 1.21.

Recently I had been looking for a good scoreboard plugin that was free, sadly at the time, I couldn't find one that worked properly. The only other options were paid ones and they were really expensive for me. So I have now created my own scoreboard plugin!
