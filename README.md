- And a lot more!

Recently I had been looking for a good scoreboard plugin that was free, sadly at the time, I couldn't find one that worked properly. The only other options were paid ones and they were really expensive for me. So I have now created my own scoreboard plugin!

This plugin is in its beta stages, in this time it will be a free project. When it's fully released it will become a premium resource, but it will be cheap! I would probably still update for future versions, just not fix any bugs or update it.

Over the next few weeks, I will be working on this to bring out as many updates as possible.
